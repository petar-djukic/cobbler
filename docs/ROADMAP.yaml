# Cobbler Roadmap
# Release schedule and use case status for cobbler.
#
# Commands use shoemaking terms mapped to autogenic self-* capabilities:
#   measure (self-orienting): assess state, propose tasks
#   stitch (self-programming): execute work via agents
#   inspect (self-reflecting): show project state
#   mend (self-reflecting): fix tests and lint
#   pattern (self-architecting): propose design changes

releases:
  - id: "00.0"
    focus: Cross-release milestones
    description: |
      Milestones that span multiple releases. These are not tied to a single
      release but track progress across the project lifecycle.
    use_cases: []
    deliverables:
      - Cupboard interface integration complete
      - Prototype scripts (make-work.sh, do-work.sh) obsolete
      - All five commands operational

  - id: "01.0"
    focus: Core stitch (docs)
    description: |
      cobbler stitch --docs working end-to-end. Agents execute documentation

  - id: "03.0"
    focus: Measure
    description: |
      cobbler measure working. Assess project state, analyze existing work,
      and propose new tasks. Replaces make-work.sh prototype.

    deliverables:
      - internal/measure command implementation
      - Prompt templates for project analysis
      - Proposal output format (JSON or structured)
      - User review and approval workflow

  - id: "04.0"
    focus: Inspect, mend, and pattern
    description: |
      Remaining self-* capabilities. inspect evaluates output quality, mend
      fixes issues found by inspect, pattern proposes design changes.
