title: Cobbler Roadmap

releases:
  - version: "00.0"
    name: Cross-release milestones
    status: planned
    description: |
      Milestones that span multiple releases. These are not tied to a single
      release but track progress across the project lifecycle.
    use_cases: []

  - version: "01.0"
    name: Core measure and stitch
    status: planned
    description: |
      Measure and stitch working end-to-end with full context injection,
      container-isolated Claude, generation lifecycle, iterative measure,
      history artifacts, config-driven orchestration, and orchestrator-managed
      git. This release combines the core execution pipeline validated by
      cobbler-scaffold.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel01.0-uc001-cupboard-connection
        summary: Connect to crumbs cupboard via Go module import
        status: planned
      - id: rel01.0-uc002-doc-task-execution
        summary: Execute a documentation task via stitch with context assembly
        status: planned
      - id: rel01.0-uc003-agent-loop
        summary: Run the agent conversation loop with tool calls and token tracking
        status: planned
      - id: rel01.0-uc004-benchmark-hello-world
        summary: Stitch a hello world Go CLI from a benchmark fixture
        status: planned

  - version: "02.0"
    name: Stitch for code
    status: planned
    description: |
      Git worktree isolation for code tasks. Task branches follow the pattern
      task/{baseBranch}-{issueID}. Quality gates (tests, lint, build) run
      before merge.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel02.0-uc001-code-task-execution
        summary: Execute a code task in a git worktree with quality gates
        status: planned
      - id: rel02.0-uc002-quality-gates
        summary: Run quality gates (test, lint, build) before closing a task
        status: planned

  - version: "03.0"
    name: Inspect, mend, and pattern
    status: planned
    description: |
      Quality evaluation in inspect, automated fixes in mend, and design
      proposals in pattern. Inspect replaces quality gates that were originally
      planned for stitch. The development loop state machine composes all five
      commands.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel03.0-uc001-project-analysis
        summary: Read project state into structured representation for the planning agent
        status: planned

        status: planned
      - id: rel03.0-uc005-mutation-testing
        summary: Measure test suite adequacy by injecting faults and checking detection
        status: planned
      - id: rel03.0-uc006-differential-testing
