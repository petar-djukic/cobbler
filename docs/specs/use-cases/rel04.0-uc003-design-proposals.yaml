title: "Use Case: Design Proposals"

summary: |
  Cobbler pattern analyzes project structure, identifies technical debt or
  design improvements, and outputs proposals as new crumbs or documentation
  updates. Pattern runs when path health degrades or on a periodic schedule.

actor: Developer running cobbler pattern or development loop

trigger: |
  Path health indicators show degradation (excessive LOC growth, increasing
  complexity) or pattern runs on its periodic schedule.

flow:
  - F1: "Cobbler detects path health degradation or periodic pattern trigger."
  - F2: "Cobbler collects project structure, recent changes, and health metrics."
  - F3: "Cobbler invokes an agent with a design analysis prompt."
  - F4: "Agent analyzes project structure and identifies improvement opportunities."
  - F5: "Agent produces design proposals as structured output."
  - F6: "Cobbler writes proposals as new crumbs in the cupboard for human review."

touchpoints:
  - T1: "Pattern command proposes architectural changes within the development loop (prd004-development-loop R1, R2, R7)"
  - T2: "Path health monitoring triggers pattern on degradation (prd004-development-loop R6)"
  - T3: "Observability traces provide execution data for design analysis (prd005-observability R5, R13)"

success_criteria:
  - S1: "Pattern agent receives project structure and health metrics"
  - S2: "Proposals are concrete and actionable"
  - S3: "Proposals are written as crumbs for human review"
  - S4: "Pattern can modify operation templates for future cycles"

out_of_scope:
  - Automatic implementation of proposals
  - Cross-project analysis
  - Recursive self-modification without human approval
