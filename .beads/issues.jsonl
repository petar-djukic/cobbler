Executive Summary: cobbler is a dispatch layer above AI agents, not an agent itself. It connects to a crumbs cupboard, prepares context, and hands off to specialized agents. Four self-* capabilities (self-orienting, self-programming, self-reflecting, self-architecting). It is not a task tracker, IDE plugin, or CI system.\n2. Introduction: context (AI agents are good at specific things - coding, planning - but waste tokens on orientation, context-gathering, and task management when left to do everything). Problem (letting an agent do everything is token-inefficient and conflates concerns; prototype bash scripts work but do not scale). What cobbler does (separates dispatch from execution; prepares focused prompts so agents spend tokens on their specialty).\n3. Why this project: fills the gap between task storage (crumbs) and agent execution. Token efficiency through separation of concerns. Plug-and-play agent swapping. Graduates prototype scripts into a real tool.\n4. Planning and Implementation: success criteria (agents complete doc and code tasks with focused prompts; agent backends are swappable), phases table (01.0 stitch docs, 02.0 stitch code, 03.0 measure, 04.0 inspect/mend/pattern), risks table.\n5. What This Is NOT: not a coding agent (agents code; cobbler dispatches). Not a planning agent (agents plan; cobbler prepares). Not a task tracker (use crumbs). Not an IDE plugin. Not a CI system. Not fully autonomous (humans approve measure output before stitch executes).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per vision-format present\n- [ ] Clear that cobbler is a dispatch layer, not an agent\n- [ ] Token efficiency rationale explained\n- [ ] Plug-and-play agent swapping described\n- [ ] Autogenic self-* capabilities and command mapping explained\n- [ ] Origin story: replaces make-work.sh and do-work.sh prototype scripts\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards (active voice, no forbidden terms, royal we)\n- [ ] File saved as docs/VISION.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:02.295666-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T21:57:12.259476-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T20:58:29.426371-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:02.297302-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}

Describe how cobbler is built: components, interfaces, data flow, and design decisions.\n\nCobbler is a dispatch layer, not an agent. It sits between the cupboard (work item storage) and agents (LLM backends). Cobbler's job is to prepare context and build focused prompts so agents spend tokens on their specialty (coding, planning, etc.) rather than on orienting themselves. The architecture must reflect this separation: cobbler handles work selection, context gathering, prompt construction, and lifecycle management. Agents handle execution.\n\nCobbler replaces prototype scripts (scripts/make-work.sh -\u003e measure, scripts/do-work.sh -\u003e stitch) with a Go tool.\n\nCommands map to self-* capabilities:\n\n| Self-capability | Command | What it does |\n|----------------|---------|-------------|\n| Self-orienting | cobbler measure | Assess project state, propose tasks |\n| Self-programming | cobbler stitch | Dispatch coding agent to execute work |\n| Self-reflecting | cobbler inspect / cobbler mend | Evaluate output, dispatch agent to fix |\n| Self-architecting | cobbler pattern | Dispatch agent to propose design changes |\n\nSections to write:\n1. System Overview: cobbler is a dispatch layer between crumbs cupboard and pluggable agents. It does not execute work itself - it prepares context and dispatches to agents. Lifecycle of a work item through cobbler (ready -\u003e claimed -\u003e context gathered -\u003e prompt built -\u003e agent dispatched -\u003e quality gate -\u003e closed). Coordination pattern: pull-based (cobbler queries cupboard for ready crumbs).\n2. Main interfaces: Cupboard integration (import crumbs Go module, Cupboard.GetTable(name).Get/Set pattern), Agent interface (pluggable - any LLM backend that implements Run can be swapped in; start with Claude), Executor interface (claim, build context, dispatch agent, close loop). The agent interface is the plug-and-play boundary.\n3. System Components: CLI (cobra, commands: measure, stitch, inspect, mend, pattern), Config (viper), Measure (reads docs/roadmap/cupboard, proposes crumbs - replaces make-work.sh), Executor/Stitch (gathers context, builds prompt, dispatches agent - replaces do-work.sh), Agent (LLM abstraction with pluggable backends; Claude impl via anthropic-sdk-go), Prompt Builder (templates that focus agent tokens on the task, not on orientation), Crumbs Client (thin wrapper around imported crumbs Go module).\n4. Design Decisions: (a) cobbler dispatches, agents execute - separation of concerns for token efficiency, (b) agent interface is the plug-and-play boundary - swap backends without changing dispatch logic, (c) import crumbs as Go module not CLI wrapper, (d) prompt templates minimize agent token spend on orientation, (e) commands named after shoemaking terms mapped to autogenic self-* capabilities.\n5. Technology Choices: Go, cobra, viper, crumbs module (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs), anthropic-sdk-go.\n6. Project Structure: cmd/cobbler/, pkg/ (agent, planner, executor, crumbs), internal/ (prompt, config, claude).\n7. Implementation Status: phase 01.0 focus is cobbler stitch --docs.\n\n## Design Decisions\n- Cobbler is dispatch, not execution: it prepares context and prompts, agents do the work\n- Agent interface is the plug-and-play boundary: any LLM backend can be swapped in\n- Prompt templates are designed for token efficiency: give agents focused context, not everything\n- Cupboard accessed via imported Go module (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs)\n- Command names from shoemaking trade mapped 1:1 to autogenic self-* capabilities\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per architecture-format present\n- [ ] Clear that cobbler is dispatch layer, agents are pluggable executors\n- [ ] Agent interface described as the plug-and-play boundary\n- [ ] Token efficiency rationale in design decisions\n- [ ] Command set (measure, stitch, inspect, mend, pattern) documented with self-* mapping\n- [ ] Design decisions numbered with rationale\n- [ ] Technology choices table present\n- [ ] Project structure directory tree present\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards\n- [ ] File saved as docs/ARCHITECTURE.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.116325-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T21:57:39.531386-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T21:00:28.763235-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.117113-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"},{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.118001-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}
