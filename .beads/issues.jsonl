Executive Summary: cobbler orchestrates AI agents for software development through four self-* capabilities (self-orienting, self-programming, self-reflecting, self-architecting). It is not a task tracker, IDE plugin, or CI system.\n2. Introduction: context (AI agents need coordination; autogenic systems that can orient, program, reflect, and architect themselves). Problem (manual agent orchestration is slow and error-prone; prototype bash scripts do not scale). What cobbler does (connects to crumbs cupboard, measures the work, stitches it via agents, inspects results, mends failures, and patterns new designs).\n3. Why this project: fills the gap between task storage (crumbs) and agent execution. Graduates prototype scripts (make-work.sh, do-work.sh) into a real tool. Leverages existing cupboard interfaces via Go module import.\n4. Planning and Implementation: success criteria (agents complete doc and code tasks autonomously via cobbler stitch), phases table (01.0 stitch docs, 02.0 stitch code, 03.0 measure, 04.0 inspect/mend/pattern), risks table.\n5. What This Is NOT: not a task tracker (use crumbs), not an IDE plugin, not a CI system, not fully autonomous (humans approve measure output before stitch executes).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per vision-format present\n- [ ] Autogenic self-* capabilities and command mapping explained\n- [ ] Origin story: replaces make-work.sh and do-work.sh prototype scripts\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards (active voice, no forbidden terms, royal we)\n- [ ] File saved as docs/VISION.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:02.295666-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T20:58:29.426371-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T20:58:29.426371-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:02.297302-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}

System Overview: cobbler connects to crumbs cupboard (imported as Go module), coordinates AI agents to measure, stitch, inspect, mend, and pattern. Lifecycle of a work item through cobbler (ready → claimed → prompt built → agent executes → quality gate → closed). Coordination pattern: pull-based (cobbler queries cupboard for ready crumbs).\n2. Main interfaces: Cupboard integration (import crumbs Go module, Cupboard.GetTable(name).Get/Set pattern), Agent interface (Run method, Tool interface), Executor interface (claim, execute, close loop).\n3. System Components: CLI (cobra, commands: measure, stitch, inspect, mend, pattern), Config (viper), Measure (reads docs/roadmap/cupboard, proposes crumbs - replaces make-work.sh), Executor/Stitch (picks up and implements work - replaces do-work.sh), Agent (LLM abstraction, Claude impl via anthropic-sdk-go), Prompt Builder (templates for doc/code tasks), Crumbs Client (thin wrapper around imported crumbs Go module).\n4. Design Decisions: (a) import crumbs as Go module not CLI wrapper, (b) agent interface for provider abstraction - Claude only first, (c) prompt templates in internal/prompt not embedded, (d) commands named after shoemaking terms mapped to autogenic self-* capabilities.\n5. Technology Choices: Go, cobra, viper, crumbs module (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs), anthropic-sdk-go.\n6. Project Structure: cmd/cobbler/, pkg/ (agent, planner, executor, crumbs), internal/ (prompt, config, claude).\n7. Implementation Status: phase 01.0 focus is cobbler stitch --docs.\n\n## Design Decisions\n- Cupboard accessed via imported Go module (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs)\n- Agent interface allows swapping LLM providers; start with Claude via anthropic-sdk-go\n- Prompt templates stored in internal/prompt/ as Go templates or embedded strings\n- Command names from shoemaking trade: measure, stitch, inspect, mend, pattern\n- Each command maps 1:1 to an autogenic self-* capability\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per architecture-format present\n- [ ] Components and interfaces described with enough detail for PRD authors\n- [ ] Command set (measure, stitch, inspect, mend, pattern) documented with self-* mapping\n- [ ] Design decisions numbered with rationale\n- [ ] Technology choices table present\n- [ ] Project structure directory tree present\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards\n- [ ] File saved as docs/ARCHITECTURE.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.116325-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T21:00:28.763235-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T21:00:28.763235-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.117113-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"},{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.118001-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}
