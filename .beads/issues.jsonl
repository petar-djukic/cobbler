It applies the autogenic systems pattern to software development.\n\nCoding agents (Claude, etc.) are guided components. They have self-programming capabilities - they can generate code and docs - but they work best with human oversight. They can run unguided, but the results may not be good. Left to work on a large task, a coding agent wastes tokens on orientation, iterates through misunderstandings, and produces inconsistent results.\n\nCobbler tests whether you can compose guided coding agents into a system that approaches recursive behavior. The hypothesis: if you break work into small enough pieces, prepare the right context for each piece, dispatch agents one-shot, and reflect on the results, the composed system behaves more like a recursive component than any individual guided agent could.\n\nThis is the research question at the heart of cobbler: can work breakdown + dispatch + self-reflection turn guided parts into a recursive whole?\n\nCobbler implements four autogenic self-* capabilities:\n\n1. Self-orienting (cobbler measure): the system generates new objectives rather than only selecting from predefined goals. Measure analyzes project state and proposes new tasks - it creates objectives, not just picks from a backlog.\n\n2. Self-programming (cobbler stitch): the system synthesizes new behaviors autonomously. Stitch dispatches a guided coding agent with a small, well-defined task and complete context. One-shot, no iteration. The agent synthesizes docs or code.\n\n3. Self-reflection (cobbler inspect / cobbler mend): the system evaluates its own reasoning processes and decision frameworks. Inspect and mend evaluate what was produced, examine whether the right checks exist, and dispatch agents to fix issues.\n\n4. Self-architecting (cobbler pattern): the system modifies its core architecture and integrates new functionality at runtime. Pattern proposes changes to ARCHITECTURE, PRDs, interfaces, and component organization.\n\nThe command set uses shoemaking metaphors:\n\n| Self-capability | Command | What it does |\n|----------------|---------|-------------|\n| Self-orienting | cobbler measure | Generate objectives from project state |\n| Self-programming | cobbler stitch | Dispatch guided agent to synthesize docs/code |\n| Self-reflection | cobbler inspect / mend | Evaluate output, dispatch agent to fix |\n| Self-architecting | cobbler pattern | Propose structural and design changes |\n\nAgents are plug-and-play. Cobbler defines an agent interface; any LLM backend can be swapped in. Different agents may be better at different tasks - a coding agent codes, a planning agent plans. Cobbler decides what to hand each agent.\n\nCobbler replaces prototype bash scripts (scripts/make-work.sh and scripts/do-work.sh) with a proper Go tool.\n\nSections to write:\n1. Executive Summary: cobbler is a partial recursive component and testbed for composing guided coding agents into recursive behavior. Applies autogenic systems pattern to software development. Not an agent itself - a dispatch layer that breaks work down and composes guided agents. Not a task tracker, IDE plugin, or CI system.\n2. Introduction: context (coding agents are guided components with self-programming capabilities, but waste tokens and produce inconsistent results on large tasks). Problem (guided agents alone do not achieve recursive behavior; large tasks cause iteration, token waste, and poor results). What cobbler does (tests whether work breakdown + one-shot dispatch + self-reflection can compose guided agents into recursive behavior). Introduce autogenic systems and the four self-* capabilities.\n3. Why this project: testbed for the guided-to-recursive composition question. Token efficiency through work breakdown. Plug-and-play agent swapping. Graduates prototype scripts. Fills gap between task storage (crumbs) and agent execution.\n4. Planning and Implementation: success criteria (guided agents complete tasks without iteration; composed system shows recursive properties - generates objectives, synthesizes behaviors, evaluates reasoning, modifies structure), phases table (01.0 stitch docs, 02.0 stitch code, 03.0 measure, 04.0 inspect/mend/pattern), risks table.\n5. What This Is NOT: not a coding agent. Not a planning agent. Not a recursive component yet (partial - testbed). Not a task tracker (use crumbs). Not an IDE plugin. Not a CI system. Not an interactive agent session.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per vision-format present\n- [ ] Clear that cobbler is a partial recursive component and testbed\n- [ ] Clear that coding agents are guided components\n- [ ] Research question stated: can work breakdown + dispatch + reflection compose guided agents into recursive behavior\n- [ ] Formal self-* definitions used\n- [ ] Work breakdown as token efficiency mechanism\n- [ ] Plug-and-play agent swapping described\n- [ ] Command mapping to self-* capabilities\n- [ ] Origin story: replaces prototype scripts\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards\n- [ ] File saved as docs/VISION.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:02.295666-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T22:36:20.471425-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T20:58:29.426371-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:02.297302-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}

The architecture must show how guided agents (which have self-programming but need oversight) are composed through work breakdown, one-shot dispatch, and self-reflection into a system that approaches recursive behavior.\n\nThe component hierarchy:\n- Coding agents (Claude, etc.) = guided components with self-programming. They generate code and docs but work best with human oversight. Unguided results may be poor.\n- Cobbler = partial recursive component. It does not execute work itself. It breaks work into small chunks, prepares context, dispatches guided agents one-shot, and reflects on results. The composition of these steps is what creates recursive-like behavior.\n\nAutogenic self-* capabilities and their architectural realization:\n\n1. Self-orienting (cobbler measure): generates new objectives by analyzing project state. Not selecting from a backlog - creating objectives. Replaces make-work.sh.\n\n2. Self-programming (cobbler stitch): dispatches a guided coding agent with a small, well-defined task. One-shot, no iteration. Agent receives complete context and returns result. Replaces do-work.sh.\n\n3. Self-reflection (cobbler inspect / cobbler mend): evaluates output and reasoning. Examines not just whether tests pass but whether the right tests exist. Dispatches agent to fix issues.\n\n4. Self-architecting (cobbler pattern): dispatches agent to propose changes to ARCHITECTURE, PRDs, interfaces, component organization.\n\nCommands:\n\n| Self-capability | Command | What it does |\n|----------------|---------|-------------|\n| Self-orienting | cobbler measure | Generate objectives from project state |\n| Self-programming | cobbler stitch | Dispatch guided agent one-shot |\n| Self-reflection | cobbler inspect / mend | Evaluate output, dispatch fix |\n| Self-architecting | cobbler pattern | Propose structural changes |\n\nSections to write:\n1. System Overview: cobbler is a partial recursive component that composes guided coding agents. It sits between crumbs cupboard and pluggable guided agents. The composition (work breakdown + one-shot dispatch + reflection) is what creates recursive-like behavior from guided parts. Lifecycle (ready -\u003e claimed -\u003e context gathered -\u003e prompt built -\u003e guided agent dispatched one-shot -\u003e result -\u003e quality gate -\u003e closed). Pull-based coordination.\n2. Main interfaces: Cupboard integration (import crumbs Go module, Cupboard.GetTable(name).Get/Set), Agent interface (the plug-and-play boundary; guided agents implement this; one-shot execution model), Executor interface (claim, gather context, build prompt, dispatch one-shot, evaluate, close). The agent interface abstracts over guided coding agents so different backends can be swapped in.\n3. System Components: CLI (cobra, commands: measure, stitch, inspect, mend, pattern), Config (viper), Measure (self-orienting: generates objectives from project analysis - replaces make-work.sh), Stitch/Executor (self-programming: prepares context, dispatches guided agent one-shot - replaces do-work.sh), Inspect/Mend (self-reflection: evaluates output, dispatches fix), Pattern (self-architecting: proposes structural changes), Agent (abstraction over guided coding agents; Claude impl via anthropic-sdk-go; plug-and-play), Prompt Builder (templates for one-shot dispatch - gives guided agent everything it needs without iteration), Crumbs Client (thin wrapper around crumbs Go module).\n4. Design Decisions: (a) cobbler is a partial recursive component composed from guided agents - the composition is the experiment, (b) work breakdown is how guided agents become useful without iteration - small tasks avoid the token waste and poor results of large tasks, (c) one-shot dispatch - no conversation with the agent, (d) agent interface abstracts over guided coding agents - plug-and-play, (e) prompt templates designed so guided agents can execute without needing to ask questions, (f) import crumbs as Go module, (g) shoemaking command names mapped 1:1 to autogenic self-* capabilities.\n5. Technology Choices: Go, cobra, viper, crumbs module (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs), anthropic-sdk-go.\n6. Project Structure: cmd/cobbler/, pkg/ (agent, planner, executor, crumbs), internal/ (prompt, config, claude).\n7. Implementation Status: phase 01.0 focus is cobbler stitch --docs (self-programming with guided coding agent for documentation).\n\n## Design Decisions\n- Cobbler is a partial recursive component composed from guided agents\n- Work breakdown makes guided agents effective without iteration\n- One-shot dispatch: no agent conversation, complete context upfront\n- Agent interface abstracts over guided coding agents: plug-and-play\n- Prompt templates designed for guided agents to execute without questions\n- Cupboard via Go module import (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs)\n- Shoemaking command names mapped 1:1 to autogenic self-* capabilities\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per architecture-format present\n- [ ] Clear component hierarchy: guided coding agents composed by partial recursive cobbler\n- [ ] Autogenic self-* capabilities mapped to architecture components with formal definitions\n- [ ] One-shot dispatch model - guided agents receive complete context, no iteration\n- [ ] Work breakdown as mechanism for making guided agents effective\n- [ ] Agent interface as plug-and-play boundary over guided coding agents\n- [ ] Command set documented with self-* mapping\n- [ ] Design decisions numbered with rationale\n- [ ] Technology choices table present\n- [ ] Project structure directory tree present\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards\n- [ ] File saved as docs/ARCHITECTURE.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.116325-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T22:36:52.715874-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T21:00:28.763235-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.117113-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"},{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.118001-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}
